1. Implement a Course site with navigation (Home, Topics, Attendees) and pages view per example: [https://dribbble.com/shots/3708155-Home-Scanner](https://dribbble.com/shots/3708155-Home-Scanner) - NOTE! Not the animation on the right, just the navigation and the table.
The Home page should be a our course description, the Topics an unordered list with the topics we covered so far and the attendees a table from the design of with the FirstName, LastName, Email and Date of Birth . On hover it should show the blue hover, like on the example.
2. In the navigation view add the User Full name and Picture which should be defined from variables and keep on page change
3. On the Attendee view, add a button "Add Another Attendee" below the Attendee table, which will show a form with inputs for First Name, Last Name, Email and Date of Birth and a button "Add". Pressing the "Add" button, adds the entered data to the bottom of the table. The inputs from the Add Attendee form, should be validated. If you switch the view, the attendee list should stay the same, with the added attendee.
